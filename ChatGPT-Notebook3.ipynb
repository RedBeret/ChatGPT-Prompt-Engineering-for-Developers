Got it fast - arrived in 2 days. The string \\\nto the lamp broke during the transit and the company \\\nhappily sent over a new one. Came within a few days \\\nas well. It was easy to put together. Then I had a \\\nmissing part, so I contacted their support and they \\\nvery quickly got me the missing piece! Seems to me \\\nto be a great company that cares about their customers \\\nand products. \n\"\"\"\n\n# review for an electric toothbrush\nreview_3 = \"\"\"\nMy dental hygienist recommended an electric toothbrush, \\\nwhich is why I got this. The battery life seems to be \\\npretty impressive so far. After initial charging and \\\nleaving the charger plugged in for the first week to \\\ncondition the battery, I've unplugged the charger and \\\nbeen using it for twice daily brushing for the last \\\n3 weeks all on the same charge. But the toothbrush head \\\nis too small. I’ve seen baby toothbrushes bigger than \\\nthis one. I wish the head was bigger with different \\\nlength bristles to get between teeth better because \\\nthis one doesn’t.  Overall if you can get this one \\\naround the $50 mark, it's a good deal. The manufactuer's \\\nreplacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can \\\nget generic ones that're more reasonably priced. This \\\ntoothbrush makes me feel like I've been to the dentist \\\nevery day. My teeth feel sparkly clean! \n\"\"\"\n\n# review for a blender\nreview_4 = \"\"\"\nSo, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \\\nsale for around $49 in the month of November, about \\\nhalf off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \\\naround the second week of December the prices all went \\\nup to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \\\nsystem. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \\\nso in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \\\nSo it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \\\nwhere the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good \\\nas in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \\\nplan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \\\nvery hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \\ \nblender first then pulverize them in the serving size \\\nI want in the blender then switch to the whipping \\\nblade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \\\nfirst when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \\\nif I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \\\nsmoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \\\nvegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \\ \nspinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \\\nsorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \\ \nthat you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \\\nmuch ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \\\nAfter about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \\\nI called customer service but the warranty expired \\\nalready, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \\\nquality has gone done in these types of products, so \\\nthey are kind of counting on brand recognition and \\\nconsumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \\\ntwo days.\n\"\"\"\n\nreviews = [review_1, review_2, review_3, review_4]\n\n",
